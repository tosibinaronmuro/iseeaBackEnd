    "story": " In February 2022, a member of our Facebook platform messaged our founder for personal coaching on self esteem and personal development. She was learning a skill and had an abusive boss who used every opportunity to emotionally and physically abuse her. A weekly coaching session was set up but barely month after, the strain got heavier and she became suicidal. To address the root cause, we began looking for opportunities to empower her and boost her self esteem. We connected her to Funmilayo's Foundation which gave her a sponsorship to a polytechnic to study Mass communication. At the moment,she is in school and we check in with her occasionally. "
